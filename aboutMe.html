                <p>
                    Everytime growing up when I looked at who I was and who I wanted to become, I paid attention to what
                    I was passionate about. From a young age, technology always seemed to fascinate me and I still
                    remember to this day coming down the stairs in the early 90’s to a Macintosh computer under the
                    Christmas tree. This is where my journey began.</p>

                <p>Fast forward to college where I started as an undecided major, however all the classes I took
                    focused around Computer Science. This was through my sophomore year when I suddenly decided I didn’t
                    want to sit behind a computer for the rest of my life, thus declaring my major. While I’m grateful
                    for my degree in Business Management and the 13+ years I spent in the finance industry as well as
                    staffing, something has always been missing. Over the years I’d try to teach myself various coding
                    languages but could never find the time or discipline to push through and get it done. That's when I
                    decided the best way to succeed would be to devote myself to a structured environment and work with
                    others to help persevere. This year, I graduated from a full stack bootcamp offered through the
                    University of Pennsylvania and it was exactly what I needed. I learned so much but was particularly
                    fond of front end development and a touch of back end.</p>

                <p>I look forward to the years to come, continuing to follow my tech journey and learning new and
                    upcoming technologies and practices. I look forward to learning from people who are better than me.
                    I look forward to becoming a true full stack developer and hopefully repaying the favor to the
                    younger generation by sharing my story and everything I’ve learned.
